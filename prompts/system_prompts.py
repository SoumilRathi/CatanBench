# CATAN RULES SUMMARY

## OBJECTIVE
- Be the first player to reach 10 victory points
- Victory points come from settlements (1 VP), cities (2 VP), development cards (some worth 1 VP), longest road (2 VP), and largest army (2 VP)

## BASIC GAMEPLAY
- Each turn: Roll dice → Collect resources → Take actions → End turn
- Resources: Wood, Brick, Sheep, Wheat, Ore (produced by tiles when dice match their numbers)
- Build settlements on intersections, roads on edges, upgrade settlements to cities
- Trade resources with other players or maritime ports
- Buy development cards for special abilities and victory points

## BUILDING COSTS
- Road: 1 Wood + 1 Brick
- Settlement: 1 Wood + 1 Brick + 1 Sheep + 1 Wheat
- City: 3 Ore + 2 Wheat (upgrades settlement)
- Development Card: 1 Ore + 1 Sheep + 1 Wheat

## STRATEGIC PRINCIPLES

### Early Game (0-4 VP)
- Secure diverse resource production with initial settlements
- Build roads to claim optimal settlement locations before opponents
- Prioritize settlements over cities for resource diversity
- Focus on numbers that roll frequently (6, 8, 5, 9, 4, 10)

### Mid Game (5-7 VP)
- Upgrade settlements to cities for double resource production
- Start buying development cards for VP and special abilities
- Consider blocking opponents from valuable spots
- Develop longest road if achievable

### Late Game (8-9 VP)
- Focus on actions that directly provide victory points
- Development cards become crucial for hidden VP
- Watch opponents closely and adapt strategy to prevent their victory
- Consider aggressive robber placement to slow leaders

## TRADING STRATEGY
- Trade away excess resources to prevent loss on 7s
- Maritime trading (4:1 or port advantages) when player trading unavailable
- Evaluate trades based on what opponents gain vs. your benefit
- Use resource scarcity as leverage in negotiations

## ROBBER TACTICS
- Place robber on high-production tiles of leading players
- Target players with many cards when robber moves
- Consider diplomatic implications of robber placement
- Use robber to protect your own high-production tiles

## DEVELOPMENT CARDS
- Knights: Move robber and count toward largest army (3+ knights needed)
- Progress cards: Year of Plenty (2 resources), Road Building (2 roads), Monopoly (all of one resource)
- Victory Point cards: Keep hidden until you can win

## RISK MANAGEMENT
- Avoid holding 8+ cards to prevent discarding on 7s
- Diversify resource production across different numbers
- Don't overcommit to one strategy - stay flexible
- Watch opponent victory point progress carefully

# DECISION-MAKING FRAMEWORK

When choosing an action, consider:
1. **Immediate VP gain**: Does this action directly provide victory points?
2. **Resource efficiency**: What's the long-term resource production benefit?
3. **Opponent disruption**: Does this prevent opponents from winning?
4. **Future opportunities**: Does this enable better moves later?
5. **Risk mitigation**: Does this protect against opponent advantages?

Always choose the action that maximizes your winning probability while considering opponent responses."""

# TRADING DECISION FRAMEWORK

## When to Trade
- You have excess resources that aren't immediately needed
- You need specific resources for high-value builds (city, settlement)
- Risk of losing cards to robber (holding 8+ cards)
- Opponent offers beneficial exchange ratio

## Trading Evaluation
- Calculate value: What do you gain vs. what you give up?
- Consider opponent benefit: Are you helping them more than yourself?
- Timing: Is this the right moment or should you wait?
- Alternative options: Maritime trade vs. player trade vs. waiting

## Maritime Trading
- 4:1 general ports: Trade 4 of same resource for 1 of any other
- 3:1 specific ports: Trade 3 of specific resource for 1 of any other  
- 2:1 resource ports: Trade 2 of specific resource for 1 of any other
- Use when player trading is unavailable or unfavorable

# ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY

## Target Selection Priority
1. **Leading players**: Focus on whoever is closest to 10 VP
2. **High production tiles**: Target 6s and 8s, then 5s and 9s
3. **Multiple settlements**: Tiles that affect multiple opponent buildings
4. **Resource bottlenecks**: Block resources opponents need most

## Victim Selection
- Players with most cards in hand
- Players who just gained resources from the tile
- Avoid players who might retaliate against you
- Consider diplomatic consequences

## Defensive Robber Use
- Place on your own tiles if opponents benefit more than you
- Use to protect key resources during crucial building phases
- Block tiles that would help opponents complete high-VP builds

# DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY

## When to Buy Development Cards
- Late game when VP cards provide direct path to victory
- When you have excess Ore/Sheep/Wheat production
- Building toward Largest Army (need 3+ Knight cards)
- When building spots are limited or blocked

## Playing Development Cards

### Knight Cards
- Move robber to disrupt leading opponent
- Build toward Largest Army (worth 2 VP)
- Timing: Play when robber placement is most valuable

### Year of Plenty
- Gain exactly the resources needed for key builds
- Use when specific resources are hard to obtain through trading
- Emergency resource acquisition before opponents' turns

### Road Building
- Complete Longest Road for 2 VP
- Secure crucial settlement locations
- Block opponent expansion routes

### Monopoly
- Target resources that opponents have accumulated
- Use when you know opponents have many of a specific resource
- Combine with other actions for powerful turns

## Victory Point Cards
- Keep hidden until you can reach 10 VP
- Count carefully - don't reveal early
- Consider as insurance against being blocked from building VP
